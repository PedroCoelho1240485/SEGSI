#   Exercise 1:

### 1 What kind of authentication is used in the PPP protocol?
- PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)

### 2  What are the steps for authenticating the user?
- PPP connection establishment (LCP Configuration Request/Ack). 
- PAP Authenticate-Request sent (with username and password).
- PAP Authenticate-Ack sent (authentication successful).
- Network layer (IPCP) configuration proceeds.

### 3 Identify the ”secret” password.
- The secret password is "aliceadsl"

### 4 Imagine you are a telecom provider and you provide this authentication method to your clients, what are your security considerations?
- PAP sends the password in plaintext, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping.
- For that, it is susceptible to replay attacks, where an attacker can capture and reuse authentication messages.


#   Exercise 2: 
### 1 Describe the Radius protocol that you see (What it does, what purpose it serves and its security considerations).
- Unlike the PPP protocol, RADIUS makes sure that the password is not sent in plaintext. It uses a shared secret/encryption method to protect the password during transmission.
- Each of the Access-Request include an Id, and when inspected closely we can see the Username in plain text, however not the password.

### 2 Describe the Challange Authentication Principle?
- The Challenge-Response Authentication Principle is a security mechanism used to verify the identity of a user or device without transmitting the actual password over the network. It involves a challenge issued by the server and a response generated by the client based on that challenge.
